        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> Can you render a 3D model that I can manipulate in the browser?
        </div>
        
        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Yes, I can provide a JavaScript-based solution using Three.js.
        </div>
        
        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> Please make it so that the cube edges are a different color, so that they're visible.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Code is provided to user for modifying the cube to include visible edges.
        </div>

        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> OK. Now make it so that you can grab it with the cursor and move it, altering its rotation.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Code is provided to user for implementing interactive rotation using OrbitControls.
        </div>

        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> Doesn't work anymore with your latest patch. Completely black screen.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Debugging suggestions and alternative approaches are provided to user.
        </div>

        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> Make it so that clicking adds a new such cube of random color to appear attached to the first. Also make it so that clicking and holding causes more to be added automatically in rapid-fire fashion.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Code is provided to user for adding cubes on click and enabling rapid-fire addition while holding the mouse button.
        </div>

        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> Clicking does nothing in Chrome nor Firefox. Another key is fine if needed to change plans.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Code is provided to user for using keyboard keys to add cubes instead of mouse clicks.
        </div>

        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> OK, not bad, but can you make it so that no cubes can overlap? They must only make contact on the edges.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Code is provided to user for ensuring cubes only touch on the edges and do not overlap.
        </div>

        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> Let's add a wave effect if you hit the 'W' key. Make it so that each cube causes the one next to it to move as well, creating a rippling effect.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Code is provided to user for implementing a wave effect where cubes move in sequence when the 'W' key is pressed.
        </div>

        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> That caused an error to be repeated in a loop.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Debugging and fixes are provided to user to resolve the looping error.
        </div>

        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> Let's update the possible directions cubes can move in. Currently, they can only move in the direction of a cube face. Let's make it so that the cubes can move in a much wider range of directions, enough to appear random.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Code is provided to user for expanding movement directions to allow more natural and randomized motion.
        </div>

        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> Let's make it so that hitting 'D' will only cause motion on a cube if that cube has not yet been moved.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Code is provided to user to ensure only unmoved cubes respond to the 'D' key wave trigger.
        </div>

        <div class="message user">
            <strong>User:</strong> OK, nice. Now let's just make it so that they move at 5 times the current speed.
        </div>

        <div class="message assistant">
            <strong>Assistant:</strong> Code is provided to user for increasing the movement speed of cubes by a factor of five.
